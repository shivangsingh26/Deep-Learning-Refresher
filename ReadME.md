# Deep Learning Series 🔥🧠

This repository contains a series of mini projects and notebooks to help me revise core Deep Learning concepts. Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific principle, model, or technique in deep learning.

## 🚀 Goals

- Refresh key deep learning principles through hands-on practice
- Implement core models from scratch or using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch
- Explore both image and structured data problems

## 📌 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📁 Structure

Each notebook is designed to be standalone. Virtual environments are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

## 🔒 Note

This repo is meant for personal learning and revision. Suggestions and improvements are welcome!
